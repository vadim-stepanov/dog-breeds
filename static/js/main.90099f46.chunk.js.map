As one of the oldest toy breeds, the affenpinscher's origins are obscure. Paintings by the old Dutch masters from the 15th century often included dogs resembling affenpinschers, but more definite evidence of the breed is absent. Small terriers adept at dispatching rats were abundant in central Europe by the 17th century. In Germany, they were used to rid stables and kitchens of rodents. Even smaller versions of these dogs were preferred for ladies, lap dogs, as they were able to kill mice in the home, warm their mistress' laps and amuse entire households with their antics. This small version eventually became the affenpinscher, which was later refined by occasional crosses with the pug, German pinscher and German silky pinscher. The affenpinscher in turn became the progenitor of other wire-coated toys, most notably the Brussels griffon. The breed was most popular in Germany, which can lay claim as his homeland. In 1936 the AKC recognized the affenpinscher, but World War II slowed any momentum in popularity the breed had gained. Since then, the breed has remained extremely rare even in America and Germany, his comparative strongholds.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/affenpinscher',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23096_affenpinscher-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affenpinscher',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/affenpinscher',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/affenpinscher/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Affenpinscher.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/affenpinscher',\n\t},\n\tairedale: {\n\t\tdesc: `Known as the \"king of terriers,\" the Airedale is the tallest terrier. Like many terriers, he counts the old English, or black and tan, terrier as one of his primary progenitors. These medium-sized dogs were prized by Yorkshire hunters for hunting a variety of game from water rats to fox. Around the mid-1800s, some of these terriers around the River Aire in South Yorkshire were crossed with otterhounds in order to improve their hunting ability around water, as well as their scenting ability. The result was a dog adept at otter hunting, originally called the Bingley or Waterside terrier but recognized as the Airedale terrier in 1878. As she entered the world of the show dog, crosses to the Irish and bull terriers were made in order to breed away from some of the remnants of the otterhound cross that were now considered less than beautiful. By 1900, the patriarch of the breed, Champion Master Briar, was gaining renown, and his offspring carried on his influence in America. The Airedale's size and gameness continued to win him worldwide fame as a hunter, even proving himself as a big game hunter. His smart looks and manners won him a place as a police dog and family pet, both roles he still enjoys.

Although he bears a likeness to dogs from ancient Japanese tombs, the modern Akita traces back to the 17th century, when a nobleman with a keen interest in dogs was exiled to the Akita Prefecture of the island of Honshu, a rugged area with intensely cold winters. He challenged the landowners there to compete in breeding a race of powerful hunting dogs. These dogs distinguished themselves in the hunting of bear, deer and wild boar, holding the game at bay for the hunter. These Akita forebears were called matagi-inu, or \"hunting dog.\" The breed's numbers and quality varied over the next 300 years. In the late 1800s, he underwent a period when he was used as a fighting dog, and some were even crossed with other breeds in an attempt to enhance his fighting prowess. In 1927, the Akita-inu Hozankai Society of Japan was formed to preserve the original Akita, and in 1931 the Akita was designated as one of Japan's natural treasures. The most honored Akita of all time was Haichiko, who greeted his master every evening at the train station to accompany him home. When his master died at work one day, Haichiko waited for him and continued to return and wait for his master every day until he died nine years later on March 8, 1935. Today, a statue and annual ceremony pay homage to Haichiko's loyalty. The first Akita arrived in America in 1937, when Helen Keller returned from Japan with one. Following World War II, servicemen returned home with Akitas from Japan. The breed's popularity grew slowly until he received AKC recognition in 1972. Since then, he has steadily gained admirers and continues to grow in popularity. The Akita is now used as a guard and police dog in Japan.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/akita',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_22906_akita-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akita_(dog)',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/akita',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/akita/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Akita.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/akita',\n\t},\n\tappenzeller: {\n\t\tdesc: `Also known as the Appenzeller Mountain Dog, this is the rarest of the four ancient Swiss mountain dog breeds.

His slight wariness around strangers and tendency to bark makes him a good watchdog, but he needs lots of early socialization so he doesn't become overly suspicious. And because of his barkiness, he's not the best dog if you have nearby neighbors. He's a great friend of children, but may nip at their heels as if they were livestock to be herded; younger Appenzellers are big and exuberant enough to accidentally knock over small kids.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/appenzeller-sennenhunde',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23244_what-is-the-appenzeller-sennenhunde-dog.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appenzeller_Sennenhund',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23244_what-is-the-appenzeller-sennenhunde-dog.jpg',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/appenzeller-sennenhunde/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: '',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: '',\n\t},\n\tbasenji: {\n\t\tdesc: `The Basenji is among the most primitive of breeds, discovered on the African Congo with Pygmy hunters. Early explorers called the dogs after the tribes that owned them or the area in which they were found, such as Zande dogs or Congo terriers. The native tribes used the dogs (which often wore large bells around their necks) as pack hunters, driving game into nets. Early attempts to bring basenjis to England in the late 1800s and early 1900s were unsuccessful because the dogs all succumbed to distemper. In the 1930s, a few dogs were successfully brought back to England and became the foundation (along with subsequent imports from the Congo and Sudan) of the breed outside of Africa. The name Basenji, or 'bush thing', was chosen. The early imports attracted much attention, and soon after the Basenji was brought to America. The breed's popularity as both a pet and show dog grew modestly but steadily. In the 1950s, a surge of popularity occurred as a result of a book and movie featuring a Basenji. The 1980s saw two important but controversial events for the Basenji in America. First, several Basenjis were brought from Africa in an attempt to widen the gene pool and combat some widespread hereditary health problems; some of these dogs introduced the previously unrecognized brindle color into the breed. Second, the Basenji was recognized by the American Sighthound Field Association as a sighthound and was allowed to compete in lure-coursing trials. Its body structure and hunting style had previously been deemed too unsighthound-like. The Basenji has always been hard to categorize. He retains several primitive characteristics, most notably his lack of barking ability and its yearly, rather than twice yearly, estrus cycle.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/basenji',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23008_basenji-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basenji',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/basenji',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/basenji/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Basenji.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/basenji',\n\t},\n\tbeagle: {\n\t\tdesc: `By the 14th century, hare hunting had become a popular sport in England, and the dogs used were probably of Beagle type. The origin of the name Beagle may be from Old French words meaning open throat in reference to the breed's melodious bay, or from the Celtic, Old English or Old French words for 'small'. The word Beagle was not used until 1475, however, but can then be found frequently in writings from the 16th century on. Hunters could follow these dogs on foot and could even carry one in a pocket if the need arose. By the 1800s, Beagles existed in several sizes, but the smaller 'pocket-size' dogs were particularly popular. These dogs measured only about 9 inches and often needed the hunter's assistance in crossing rough fields. One of the special appeals of the smaller beagles was that the hunt could be followed even by ladies, the aged or the infirm, as they slowly followed the winding path of the hare. The first mention of the Beagle in America was in 1642. Beagles were used in the South prior to the Civil War, but these dogs bore little resemblance to their English counterparts. After the war, English imports formed the basis of the modern American Beagle. By the end of the 19th century, Beagles were popular competitors in both field and conformation exhibitions. But the merry little scenthound did not stop there: He continued to become one of America's all-time favorite breeds, finding his special niche as a family pet.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/beagle',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23012_beagle-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/beagle',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/beagle/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Beagle.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/beagle',\n\t},\n\tbluetick: {\n\t\tdesc: `Like many Coonhounds, the Bluetick gets its name from its coat, which is covered in black hairs that give it the mottled, or “ticked” pattern for which it is named.

Coursing of hare for sport was known in Russia as early as the 13th century. In the 15th and 16th centuries, crosses of coursing hounds with bear hounds and with tall Russian sheepdogs were made to increase size and coat, both necessary for hunting wolves in the cold climate. The first standard was written in the 1600s in a book of Borzoi hunting rules. Perhaps no other breed has ever been the focus of hunting on such a grand scale. Hundreds of serfs worked in the upkeep of the hounds on huge estates; the hunts themselves were grand events. One account describes the hounds, horses, beaters and hunters arriving in a train of over 40 cars, with another train bringing the grand duke and other nobility. Over 100 borzois might partake in a hunt. Beaters and scent hounds initially trailed the wolf, followed by hunters on horseback. A pair or trio (consisting of two males and a female) of matched Borzois were then unleashed when the wolf was sighted. The dogs would strike at the same time, forcing the wolf down and holding it until the hunter arrived to bind the wolf and then, often, set it free. By the 1800s, seven distinct subtypes of borzoi existed in Russia. Most present Borzois descend from the Perchino type kept by Grand Duke Nicolai Nicolayevitch, and many of the early American imports came directly from the Perchino kennels. The Russian czar would often present Borzois as gifts to visiting royalty. After the Russian Revolution, the days of the nobility were over and many borzois were killed. The fate of the breed was left in the hands of foreign royalty who had been given Borzois and of a few remaining Borzoi kennels. In America, the Borzoi soon gained the reputation as the ultimate glamour dog, often seen at the sides of movie stars. Although only enjoying modest popularity as a pet, the breed remains a popular show dog, coursing dog and model.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/borzoi',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23018_borzoi-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borzoi',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/borzoi',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/borzoi/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Borzoi.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/borzoi',\n\t},\n\tbouvier: {\n\t\tdesc: `The Bouvier des Flandres served farmers and cattle merchants in controlling cattle in the great farmlands of southwest Flanders and on the French northern plain. In fact, Bouvier means 'cowherd' or 'oxherd', in French, although the dogs were formerly more often called vuilbaard (dirty beard) or koe hond (cow dog). Besides its main duty as a cattle drover, the Bouvier was an all-around farm dog, functioning also as a livestock and farm guard and draft dog. As expected from a dog selected to perform a variety of tasks, these working dogs were of a variety of types, colors and even sizes. This wide variety also reflected the fact that this was a working dog, and breeding stock was chosen by ability, not pedigree or esthetics. The derivation of the breed is not documented but may have included Mastiff, Sheepdog and possibly even Spaniel breeds. The first breed standard, drawn up in 1912, reflected this diversity of types and signaled a growing interest in the breed from dog fanciers. In the midst of the breed's rising popularity, most of the Bouviers were lost in World War I although some served as ambulance and messenger dogs during the war. One of the few survivors was of such superior quality that the breed was successfully revived through his progeny. This dog, Ch.

Bullenbaiser means \"bull biter,\" and these dogs were used to grab large game (wild boars, deer and small bears) after it was at bay, hanging onto it until the hunter arrived to kill it. This required a strong but agile dog with a broad powerful jaw and a recessed nose to enable the dog to breathe while his jaws were clamped onto an animal. Similar attributes were required of dogs used in bull-baiting, a popular sport in many European countries. In England, the bulldog was the favored breed for the sport, whereas in Germany large mastiff-type dogs were used. Around the 1830s, German hunters began a concerted effort to create a new breed, crossing their bullenbaisers with mastiff-type dogs for size, terriers for tenacity and, finally, bulldogs. The result was a tough agile dog with a streamlined body and strong grip. When bull-baiting was outlawed, the dogs were mostly used as butcher's dogs in Germany, controlling cattle in slaughter yards. By 1895, an entirely new breed, the boxer, had been established. Although the exact origin of the name boxer is obscure, he may have been derived from the German boxl, as they were called in the slaughterhouses. The boxer was one of the first breeds to be employed as a police and military dog in Germany. By 1900, the breed had become established as a general utility dog, a family pet and even a show dog. The AKC recognized the breed soon after, but only in the 1940s did the breed begin his steady rise to the top of the popularity charts, eventually peaking as the fourth-most popular breed in America.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/boxer',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_22916_boxer-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_(dog)',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/boxer',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/boxer/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Boxer.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/boxer',\n\t},\n\tbriard: {\n\t\tdesc: `The Briard is one of four French Sheepdog breeds, the others being the Beauceron, Picardy and Pyrenean. It is the oldest of the four breeds, with dogs resembling Briards depicted in art from as long ago as the eighth century, and more definitive evidence by the 14th century. These early dogs were known as Chien Berger de Brie (shepherd dog of Brie), giving rise to the belief that the breed originated in the province of Brie; however, it may also be a corruption of Chien d'Aubry, referring to the dog of Aubry de Montdidier, which saved his son's life (according to 14th-century legend). The name Briard was not used until 1809. Originally employed as a herd protector, the Briard was expected to tackle wolves if the need arose. After the French Revolution, which resulted in the country's land being divided into smaller sectors, it was important that the flocks be kept close to home, and the Briard turned his talents to herding rather than guarding sheep. Only around 1900 did it become a show dog. The first breed standard was written in 1897, but was replaced by another in 1909. Briards came to America very early, with evidence that both Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson brought some of the first specimens to the New World. These dogs did not have a lasting influence, however. After World War I, American soldiers brought some Briards to America, and this was the beginning of the modern American Briard. The breed's popularity has been modest in America, but he remains the most popular sheep herder in his native France.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/briard',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23182_briard-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briard',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/briard',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/briard/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Briard.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/briard',\n\t},\n\tbulldog: {\n\t\tdesc: `With the most distinctive mug in dogdom, the Bulldog has an equally distinctive history. The Bulldog's origin lies in the cruel sport of bull-baiting, which originated in England around the 13th century. The dog's purpose was to attack and madden the bull by grabbing it, usually by the nose, and not releasing its grip. Not only was this considered entertainment, but it also was believed that a bull's meat was tastier if the bull was baited before being butchered. Some bulldogs were also set against bears for bearbaiting, purely for entertainment. Bulldog owners set great store by their dog's ferocity and, especially, fortitude in the face of pain, so much so that horrifying stories exist of handlers proving their dog's toughness by demonstrating that it would hang onto the bull despite being tortured or mutilated by the handler. In 1835, bull-baiting was outlawed, and a new phase began for the Bulldog. Some efforts were made to have the dogs fight one another, but this was clearly not the Bulldog's forte. Now a dog without a cause, the breed's popularity plummeted. By all rights, the breed should have become extinct, except that it had gained so many ardent admirers that they set out to rescue the bulldog by selecting against ferocity while still maintaining and often accentuating his distinctive physical characteristics. So successful were they that the Bulldog became an extremely amiable character, with a personality not at all like its sourmugÃ might suggest. His tough steadfast persona led him to be identified as a national symbol of England. His amiable clownish personality belies his appearance, and the bulldog is a popular pet.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/bulldog',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23140_bulldog-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulldog',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/bulldog',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bulldog/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Bulldog.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/bulldog',\n\t},\n\tbullterrier: {\n\t\tdesc: `Bull-baiting and dog fighting were long considered great entertainment by many Europeans, and patrons were constantly trying crosses to achieve the ultimate fighting dog. Around 1835, a cross between a bulldog and the old English terrier produced a particularly adept pit dog known as the \"bull and terrier.\" A later cross to the Spanish pointer added needed size, and the result was a tenacious, strong, yet agile dog that came to dominate the pits. As interest in the exhibition of dogs grew in England, little attention was paid to these dogs so long associated with the lower echelons of society. With the abolition of dog fighting, however, some bull terrier patrons turned to this new venue to compete with their dogs, and they began to breed for appearance. Around 1860 James Hinks crossed the bull and terrier with the White English terrier and the Dalmatian, producing an all-white strain he called bull terriers. The new all-white strain immediately succeeded in the ring and captured the attention of the public; they became a fashionable companion for young gentlemen who wanted a good-looking masculine dog at their sides. The dogs gained the reputation for defending themselves, but not provoking a fight, and were thus dubbed \"the white cavalier.\" The dogs gradually became more streamlined, and the bull terrier's distinctive head evolved. Around 1900, crosses with Staffordshire bull terriers reintroduced color into the breed. He was not well-accepted at first, but he finally gained equal status as a separate AKC variety in 1936. The white variety still continues as the more popular variety, but both colors have enjoyed great popularity as show dogs and pets.

These dogs seem to have existed since the 15th century and were used to hunt fox, badger and otter. The dogs were adept at bolting otters from the cairns (piles of stone that served as landmarks or memorials). The dogs came in a variety of colors, ranging from white to gray to red, and were all considered Scotch terriers when they began to enter the show ring. In 1873, they were divided into Dandie Dinmont and Skye terriers, with the cairn in the latter group. This group was later again divided into Skye and hard-haired terriers in 1881, and the hard-haired terriers eventually separated into Scotch, West Highland white and the breed eventually known as the cairn. At one time, the cairn was called the shorthaired Skye, then the cairn terrier or Skye and finally, around 1912, the cairn terrier. Some of the most influential early cairns were all white, but white, as well as crossing to West Highland whites, was banned by the 1920s. The breed became quite popular in England, and fairly popular in America, gaining his greatest fame as the dog playing Toto in the Wizard of Oz. As one of the more natural and less sculpted terriers, the breed is highly regarded by those who appreciate a working terrier.

The cattle raised on these lands became so wild and intractable that the traditional European herding breeds that had proved satisfactory on tamer cattle were no longer suited for the job. A dog was needed that could withstand traveling long distances over rough terrain in hot weather and that could control cattle without barking (which only served to make wild cattle wilder). In 1840, a man named Hall bred some smooth blue-merle Highland Collies to Dingos, producing a strain known as Heelers. One particularly influential stud was a dog named Bentleydog, who is credited with stamping the white blaze found on the head of Australian Cattle Dogs today. Other breeders crossed their Heelers with other breeds, including the Bull Terrier, Dalmatian and, later, black-and-tan Kelpie, a sheep-herding breed. The result was a dog with the herding instincts of the Collie and Kelpie; the endurance, ruggedness and quiet style of the Dingo; and the horse sense and protectiveness of the Dalmatian, all with a distinctively patterned coat. As the dogs became increasingly vital to the cattle industry of Queensland, they gained the name Queensland Blue Heeler. They later became known as Australian Heeler, and then Australian Cattle Dog. A standard for the breed, emphasizing his Dingo characteristics, was drawn up in 1897. The Australian Cattle Dog was slow to catch on in America, however, perhaps because he bore little resemblance to established herding breeds. When given a chance, he proved his merits and was welcomed as a herder and pet. The AKC recognized the breed in 1980, and he has since become a capable show dog, without sacrificing his functional makeup.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/australian-cattle-dog',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23166_australian-cattle-dog-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Cattle_Dog',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/australian-cattle-dog',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/australian-stump-tail-cattle-dog/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Australian-Cattle-Dog.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/australian-cattle-dog',\n\t},\n\tchihuahua: {\n\t\tdesc: `The smallest breed of dog, the Chihuahua has a controversial history. One theory holds that she originated in China and was brought to the New World by Spanish traders, where she was then crossed with small native dogs. The other theory contends that she originated entirely in Central and South America, descending from the native Techichi, a small mute dog that was sometimes sacrificed in Toltec religious rituals. A small red dog was believed to guide the soul to the underworld, and every Aztec family kept such a dog, which was sacrificed and buried with any deceased family member. To make matters worse for the Techichi, the Toltecs and their conquerors, the Aztecs, often ate dogs and the Techichi may have sometimes been on the menu. Despite what may have been short lives, Techichis apparently were well-cared for during life by the priests or their families. In fact, the most likely origin of the Chihuahua is a combination of these theories: The native Techichi was probably crossed with tiny hairless Chinese dogs, but again the date when this occurred is controversial. The Chinese dogs may have been brought over when a land bridge spanned the Bering Strait, or they may have been brought later by Spanish traders. When Cortes conquered the Aztecs in the 16th century, the little dogs were abandoned and left to fend for themselves. About 300 years later, in 1850, three tiny dogs were found in Chihuahua, Mexico. A few were brought to the United States, but they aroused only moderate attention. Only when Xavier Cugat (\"the rhumba king\") appeared in public with a Chihuahua as his constant companion did the breed capture the public's hearts.

Because of this, it has been proposed that the chow chow either descends from Spitz forebears or is an ancestor of some of the Spitz breeds.

The Chow Chow's original purpose may have been as a hunting dog, sniffing out and even pointing birds for the nobility. The breed declined in quality and numbers after the imperial hunts were ended, but a few pure descendants were kept in isolated monasteries and wealthy households. Other accounts contend that the breed was a source of fur pelts and food in Manchuria and Mongolia. One of the most distinctive features of the breed is the black tongue, which was also the basis for his more common names in China. Only when dogs were brought to England along with other Chinese importations in the late 1700s was the name Chow Chow adopted. The name is probably derived from a term simply meaning Oriental knickknack and assorted curios, and may have come to be applied to the dogs because they were lumped into a ship's log of cargo. These early imports were, in fact, looked upon as curios. Not until the late 1800s was the breed imported to England and then America in earnest. Queen Victoria's interest in these dogs helped draw attention to the breed. AKC recognized the chow chow in 1903.

The breed did not get his name until around the time of the French Revolution, when it is believed that the Duc de Noailles of France moved his spaniel kennels to the Duke of Newcastle's English estate, Clumber Park. Clumber spaniels appealed to the English nobility, who appreciated this slow-moving but especially keen-nosed hunter that was also an adept retriever. The breed was not readily available to commoners, because the nobility discouraged his popularity except among higher society.

One theory of the name's origin is that it was derived from a Gaelic word meaning useful, which certainly described the useful farm or stock dogs valued by the Celts who first settled on the British Isles. Although sheep herding and guarding are some of the most ancient of canine services, evidence of the Collie dates only from about 1800. Both rough- and smooth-coated 'Scotch' Collies existed by that time, but they apparently were derived from different crosses. The rough-coated dogs were characteristically smaller and broader headed, and usually black or black and white. As the breed caught the interest of dog fanciers, both rough- and smooth-coated Collies became taller and more refined. The rough-coated Collie was especially influenced by the progeny of a dog named 'Old Cockie', born in 1867 and thought to be responsible not only for setting type but also for introducing the sable color. Around this same time, Queen Victoria became enthusiastic about the breed; under her sponsorship, the Collie's popularity grew not only with Shepherds appreciative of his working value but also with members of the upper class, who were enamored of his beauty. By 1886 a standard was drawn up that still describes the breed as it is today. Meanwhile, as sheep herding became more important in America, settlers brought collies with them to the New World. In 1878, Queen Victoria once again put the breed in the limelight by entering two collies in the Westminster Dog Show. This provided the impetus for America's social elite to join the collie clan, and soon the collie could be found in some of the most prestigious estates in America. Later the Collie found a champion in Albert Payson Terhune, whose stories about collies heightened their popularity with people from all walks of life. The most famous collie of all, the television star Lassie, further popularized the breed, helping to make the rough collie one of the all-time favorite breeds in America.

They trailed in the fashion of their Bloodhound ancestors, with nose to ground but at a somewhat swifter pace. Although they will trail any mammal, they specialize in raccoons and opossums, often trailing at night. When the quarry is treed, the dogs bay until the hunter arrives and shoots the animal.

His derivation is unknown, though he may have been influenced by the extinct English turn-spit dog, a short-legged, low-bodied dog used to turn spits in kitchens. Initially used as a family protector and even a helper in the hunt, he was only later that the Corgi found his true forte. In a time when the land available to tenant farmers was determined by how much acreage their cattle occupied, it was to the farmer's advantage to have scattered, far-ranging stock. Thus, a dog that would drive, rather than herd, the cattle was an invaluable aid, and the Corgi stepped right into this role, nipping at the cattle's heels and ducking their kicks. In fact the word Corgi is probably derived from cor (to gather) and gi (dog). The original Corgis were supposed to measure a Welsh yard (slightly longer than an English yard) from nose to tail tip, and in parts of Cardiganshire the breed was called the yard-long dog or ci-llathed. When the Crown lands were later divided, sold and fenced, the need for drovers was lost, and the corgi lost hlkis job. Kept by some as a guard and companion, nonetheless, it became a luxury that few could afford, and it became perilously close to extinction. Crosses with other breeds had been tried, but most were not particularly successful. The exception was the cross with the brindle herder present-day Cardigans are the products of this slight herder influence. The first Cardigans were shown around 1925. Until 1934, the Cardigan and Pembroke Welsh Corgis were considered one breed, and interbreeding between the two was common.

The modern name Dachshund means simply badger (dachs) dog (hund) in German. These tenacious hunters would follow their quarry, enter its burrow, pull it out and kill it. The Dachshund comes in three coat varieties and two sizes. The original Dachshunds were smooth-coated and arose from crosses of the bracke, a miniature French pointer, with the Pinscher, a vermin killer of Terrier type. Some 16th-century woodcuts provide evidence of longer-haired Dachshund-like dogs. It is also possible that smooth Dachshunds were later crossed with Spaniels and the German Stoberhund (a gun dog) to produce the longhaired variety. Mention is made of wire-coated Dachshunds as early as 1797, but these dogs were not carefully bred and most modern wires were created around the end of the 19th century by crossing smooth Dachshunds with German Wirehaired Pinschers and the Dandie Dinmont Terrier. Each of these varieties was best suited for hunting under slightly different terrain and climatic conditions, but all were tough, strong dogs capable of dispatching badgers, foxes and other small mammals. Before 1900, very small Dachshunds were kept for going to ground after small quarry, such as rabbits. Although some were simply runts, others were intentionally produced from crosses with Toy Terriers or Pinschers. Most of the resulting miniatures lacked Dachshund type, however. By 1910, stricter criteria were adopted for type, and each coat type was crossed with different breeds to achieve the best results: Smooths were bred with the Miniature Pinscher, longs with the Papillon and wires with the Miniature Schnauzer. The Dachshund has since found his real niche as a family pet, steadily rising in popularity to hold a place as one of the most popular hounds in America.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/dachshund-(standard)',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23020_dachshund-dog-breed-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dachshund',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/dachshund',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/dachshund/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Dachshund.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/dachshund',\n\t},\n\tdalmatian: {\n\t\tdesc: `The spotted Dalmatian is the most distinctly patterned breed of any dog, but the origin of his coat pattern is unknown. In fact, although art evidence points to an ancient origin, the time and place of the breed's birth is also unknown. He gets his name from Dalmatia, a region in western Yugoslavia, but probably did not originate there. Their ancestors may have included a small version of the spotted Great Dane or pointers, though this, too, is conjectural. Even the breed's original function is unclear, but that is more likely because of his use in so many roles rather than any lack of employment. These roles included war dog, sentinel, shepherd, draft dog, ratter, retriever, bird dog, trailer and even circus dog. It was as a coach dog in Victorian England, however, that the Dalmatian found his niche. The coach dog served both a practical and aesthetic role; he protected the horses from marauding dogs and added a touch of style to the procession. The dogs would trot alongside, in front or beneath the axle (considered the most elegant position) of the coach; interestingly, some evidence exists that coaching position may have a hereditary component. With the advent of the automobile, the Dalmatian lost his place in high society, and his popularity declined. He continued as a coach dog for horse-drawn fire engines, and this association led to his adoption as the modern 'fire dog'. His flashy coloration has always ensured that he has been popular as a pet and show dog; however, his feature in popular children's movies has catapulted the breed to one of the most popular breeds in America in the years following the movie releases.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/dalmatian',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23146_dalmatian-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatian_dog',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/dalmatian',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/dalmatian/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Dalmatian.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/dalmatian',\n\t},\n\tdane: {\n\t\tdesc: `Dubbed the \"Apollo of Dogs,\" the Great Dane is probably the product of two other magnificent breeds, the old English mastiff and the Irish wolfhound. Her ancestors were used as war dogs and hunting dogs; thus, her ability as a fearless big-game hunter seemed only natural. By the 14th century, these dogs were proving themselves as able hunters in Germany, combining speed, stamina, strength and courage in order to bring down the tough wild boar. The noble dogs became popular with the landed gentry not only because of their hunting ability but also because of their imposing yet graceful appearance. They made gracious additions to any estate. British people familiar with the breed first referred to Great Danes as German boarhounds. Exactly when and why the breed was later dubbed the Great Dane is a mystery because, although undeniably great, she is not Danish. She is a German breed, and in 1880 German authorities declared that the dog should only be referred to as the Deutsche dogge, the name by which she still goes in Germany. The English paid no heed, and the old name stuck for the English-speaking world. By the late 1800s, the Great Dane had come to America. She quickly attracted attention, as she does to this very day. The breed has since achieved great popularity in spite of some of the difficulties that owning a giant dog entails.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/great-dane',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_22926_great-dane-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Dane',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/great-dane',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/great-dane/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Great-Dane.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/great-dane',\n\t},\n\tdeerhound: {\n\t\tdesc: `Among the most aristocratic of breeds, the Scottish Deerhound has been valued by nobility for his prowess in running down deer at least since the 16th century. Confusion regarding names makes tracing his exact history before that time difficult, but he is probably a very ancient breed, deriving from ancestral greyhound roots. Like his smooth-coated Greyhound relative, the rough-coated Deerhound could not be kept by anyone ranked lower than an Earl during the age of chivalry. As the stag population declined in England, the larger, rough-coated dogs suited for hunting stag became concentrated where the stag remained plentiful, namely, the Scottish Highlands, where they were valued and hoarded by Highland chieftains. This hoarding resulted in the decline of the breed in the mid-1700s following the collapse of the clan system of Culloden. Further decline occurred with the advent of breech-loading rifles in the 1800s, because hunting deer with guns supplanted coursing in popularity. By the mid-1800s, however, a concerted effort to restore the breed had proved successful, and although its numbers were never great, the quality of the dogs was high. The first deerhound club was formed in England in the 1860s, around the same time the first deerhounds were exhibited in dog shows. The First World War again decimated the breed's numbers because most of the dogs had been the property of a limited number of large estates, most of which did not survive the war intact. Since then, the Deerhound has remained low in number but high in quality, a classic in every sense.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/scottish-deerhound',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23046_scottish-deerhound-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Deerhound',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/scottish-deerhound',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/scottish-deerhound/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Scottish-Deerhound.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/scottish-deerhound',\n\t},\n\tdoberman: {\n\t\tdesc: `Few people can claim to have had so great an impact upon the dog world as Louis Dobermann of Thuringen, Germany. Dobermann was a door-to-door tax collector who needed a watchful guard dog to accompany him on his rounds. In the late 1800s he set about to create an alert streamlined guard dog, most likely by crossing the old German shepherd and German pinscher, with later crosses of the black and tan Manchester terrier, greyhound and Weimaraner. He soon obtained the prototype of the breed that now bears his name. The original Dobermans were still somewhat heavy-boned and round-headed; subsequent breeders selected for a more racy-looking dog. The breed evolved in remarkable time; by 1899 the first breed club was formed. The breed continued to attract acclaim, and the first Doberman arrived in America in 1908. She soon found favor throughout Europe and America as a police and guard dog, and later as a war dog. Her prowess in these areas soon brought more admirers, and the Doberman quickly became a valued family protector. Her chiseled silhouette and fearless alert demeanor has made the Doberman a top contender as a show dog. As her fame grew, many families grew to appreciate the breed as a family pet, and the Doberman eventually rose to be the second-most popular breed in America in 1977. During this same period, a new challenge arose for the breed, the emergence of the albinistic white Doberman. In an effort to decrease the chance of producing these dogs, the Doberman Pinscher Club of America convinced the AKC to tag the registration numbers of dogs with the likelihood of carrying the albino gene with the letter Z.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/doberman-pinscher',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_22920_doberman-pinscher-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobermann',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/doberman-pinscher',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/doberman-pinscher/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Doberman-Pinscher.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/doberman-pinscher',\n\t},\n\telkhound: {\n\t\tdesc: `The Elkhound is an unusual hound because his roots lie in the Spitz breeds, which he still closely resembles. This breed's placement in the hound group reflects his hunting ability because he hunts like a hound. Still, the Elkhound is a breed of many skills. He has served humans as a hunter, guardian, herder and defender at least since the time of the Vikings. In a land of subzero temperatures, deep snow, thick forests and rugged mountains, only the hardiest of breeds could evolve to perform the variety of jobs at which the Elkhound excels. Of all his roles, hunting elk (actually, moose) is this breed's forte. Two hunting-style Elkhounds are used: The Bandhund is attached by a long line to the hunter while trailing the elk, while the Loshund runs ahead trailing until he is within striking range. His goal is to hold the elk at bay, and will hunt quietly if the animal begins to run away. If the elk stops, the dog begins barking furiously to alert the hunter. Nimbly jumping in and out toward the elk, he deftly avoids the swinging antlers. Either way, the Elkhound's job is not to kill the elk, but to locate it and hold it at bay for the hunter. Although the breed had been carefully bred for centuries, only since the late 1800s were pedigrees kept and breeding according to standard performed. The breed has been exhibited in Scandinavian dog shows since that time and was brought to England and America shortly thereafter. The AKC recognized the breed around 1930, and it has enjoyed moderate popularity since then. In Scandinavia, the Elkhound is still tested by grueling elk hunts that may entail an entire day of trailing.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/norwegian-elkhound',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23032_norwegian-elkhound-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Elkhound',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/norwegian-elkhound',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/norwegian-elkhound/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Norwegian-Elkhound.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/norwegian-elkhound',\n\t},\n\tentlebucher: {\n\t\tdesc: `The Entlebucher is a compact, strongly muscled, elongated drover with ample bone.

In fact, the American Eskimo dog descended from one of the varieties of Spitz developed in Germany, with influences from other Spitz breeds such as the Keeshond, Pomeranian, and Volpino Italiano. Ironically, it was the success of these other breeds that held the Eskie back. Although the Keeshond originally came in several colors, when it was decided to accept only gray specimens, the white Keeshonden were suddenly excluded. When the Pomeranian standard was drawn up to exclude dogs over 8 pounds, larger dogs were excluded as Pomeranians. Thus, by the early 1900s, there was two groups of medium-sized white dogs that, although purebreds, were excluded from their breeds. Their fate is unknown, but it is likely that they became pets of the working people. When European workers came to America, they brought these dogs with them. The turning point came in the 1920s, when the American Spitz (as he had come to be called) became a favorite of circus performers. Spectators often left the circus with a new family member, an offspring of one of the dazzling performers. Many present-day Eskies can be traced back to their circus ancestors. After World War I, the breed's name was changed to American Eskimo, to remove any Germanic sound from it. Most Eskies were kept as pets and farm dogs. A few families registered their dogs with the United Kennel Club, but it wasn't until 1994 that the AKC recognized the breed. Despite his acceptance into the AKC world of show dogs, the Eskie remains a dog of the people, far more popular as a pet than as a competitor.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/american-eskimo-dog-(toy)',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23134_american-eskimo-dog-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Eskimo_Dog',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/american-eskimo-dog',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/american-eskimo-dog/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/American-Eskimo-Dog.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/american-eskimo-dog',\n\t},\n\tgermanshepherd: {\n\t\tdesc: `Despite an outward appearance slightly resembling a wolf, the German Shepherd dog is a fairly recently developed breed and, contrary to naiÃÂ­ve beliefs, he is no more closely related to the wolf than any other breed of dog. The breed is the result of a conscious effort to produce the ideal Shepherd, capable of herding and guarding his flocks. Perhaps never in the history of any breed has such concerted effort been put into improving a dog, mostly due to the formation in 1899 of the Verein fur Deutsche Scharferhunde SV, an organization devoted to overseeing the breeding of the German Shepherd. Breeders sought to develop not only a herding dog but also one that could excel at jobs requiring courage, athleticism and intelligence. In short order, the German Shepherd had proved itself a more than capable police dog, and subsequent breeding strove to perfect his abilities as an intelligent and fearless companion and guardian. During World War I, it was the obvious choice for a war sentry. At the same time, the AKC changed the breed's name from German Sheepdog to Shepherd dog, and Britain changed it to Alsatian Wolf Dog, both attempts to dissociate the dog from the unpopular German roots. The wolf dog was later dropped as it caused many people to fear the breed. In 1931, the AKC restored the breed's name to German Shepherd Dog. The greatest boon to the shepherd's popularity came in the form of two dogs, both movie stars: Strongheart and Rin Tin Tin. The German Shepherd held the number-one spot in American popularity for many years. Although presently he has dropped from the top spot, the German Shepherd remains as one of the most versatile dogs ever created, serving as a police dog, war dog, guide dog, search-and-rescue dog, narcotics- or explosives-detecting dog, show dog, guard dog, pet and even shepherd.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/german-shepherd-dog',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23188_german-shepherd-dog-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Shepherd',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/german-shepherd-dog',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/german-shepherd-dog/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/German-Shepherd-Dog.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/german-shepherd-dog',\n\t},\n\tgreyhound: {\n\t\tdesc: `One of the first types of dogs selectively bred by humans was the Sighthound, a dog that could run after and catch game by outrunning it. The prototypical Sighthound has always been the Greyhound. Greyhound-like dogs have been depicted since ancient Egyptian, Greek and Roman times. The name Greyhound may come from Graius, meaning, Greek, or from the Latin gradus, denotingÃ¢â¬Â¦high grade. By the time of the Saxons, Greyhounds were well-established in Britain and were valued both by commoners, for their ability to put food on the table, and by nobility, for the sport of the chase. In 1014 the Forest Laws prohibited all but nobility from keeping Greyhounds near royal forests unless they had been \"lamed\"; these laws remained in effect for 400 years. Even when they were repealed, Greyhounds remained the dogs of nobility because with the growing importance of agriculture and domestic animal food sources, the running dog was not economically advantageous. Instead, Greyhounds were used for coursing hare for sport, and during the 1800s coursing became a consuming pastime of the upper class. Early American immigrants often brought Greyhounds with them to the New World, where they proved adept at coursing on the open plains. When coursing was made available to the masses by staging him first in closed parks and then on tracks after a mechanical lure, the Greyhound's fate was sealed. Track racing proved so popular that dogs were bred specifically for short bursts of speed, ultimately resulting in the fastest breed of dog. At the same time, Greyhounds entered the show ring. The breed soon became divided into show and racing types, which were seldom interbred. In America, the Greyhound is one of the least popular breeds according to AKC registrations of show stock. The National Greyhound Association registers many thousands of Greyhounds annually; however, recently retired racers from NGA stock have become popular as pets.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/greyhound',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23024_greyhound-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greyhound',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/greyhound',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/greyhound/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Greyhound.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/greyhound',\n\t},\n\tgroenendael: {\n\t\tdesc: `The first impression of the Belgian Sheepdog is that of a well balanced, square dog, elegant in appearance, with an exceedingly proud carriage of the head and neck.

By a stroke of fate, the breed became entangled in the political events of Holland in the years preceding the French Revolution. The leader of the patriot faction was a man named Kees de Gyselaer, who in turn owned a barge dog named Kees. The dog Kees appeared in so many political cartoons that he and his breed 'a dog of the people' became the symbol of the patriots. Unfortunately for the Keeshond, the patriots did not prevail, and many Keeshond owners disposed of their dogs lest they be identified with the losing party. To make things worse for the Keeshond, the barges that floated the Rhine became larger, and the small Keeshond became less favored as a barge dog. Nonetheless, the breed did survive, although with a low profile, through the efforts of a few loyal river boatmen and farmers. In 1920, Baroness van Hardenbroek began an effort to rescue the surviving members. She was so successful at winning friends for the breed that the Keeshond was in England by 1925.

These dogs bore a close resemblance to the Magyar sheep known as racka, which had a proud \"doglike\" carriage and masses of curly wool. Thus, the dogs easily intermingled with the sheep and at first glance appeared to be one of the flock. Greatly valued by the Magyar shepherds, the komondorok were not allowed to interbreed with other breeds. The earliest documentation of the breed dates back to 1555, although the breed is certain to have existed long before then. The komondor earned his keep by guarding the flocks against marauding animals. He was so effective that some claim he is responsible for wiping out the wolf in Hungary. The komondor was still used as a guard into the 20th century. The first komondor came to America in 1933, and the AKC recognized the breed in 1937. World War II almost decimated the breed in Europe, but through the concerted efforts of breeders, the komondor was saved. Although he is one of the most impressive dogs to ever grace the show ring, the difficulty of preparing his coat has usually dictated that none but the very finest be shown. As a result, the komondor remains an uncommon breed everywhere but in his native Hungary. Recent attempts to use the breed as a guardian of flocks in the western United States have yielded promising results, attracting the attention of a new generation of shepherds.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/komondor',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_22930_komondor-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komondor',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/komondor',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/komondor/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Komondor.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/komondor',\n\t},\n\tkuvasz: {\n\t\tdesc: `Although considered a Hungarian breed, the kuvasz has his roots in giant dogs of Tibet.

At one time only those nobility in favor with the royal family were allowed to keep one. This is a very old breed; in the latter 15th century, the kuvasz was held in the highest esteem. Breedings were carefully planned and recorded, and the dogs were a fixture of most large Hungarian estates. They served as both guard and hunting dog, capable of defending the estate against marauders and of pulling down large game such as bear and wolf. King Matthias I was a special patron of the kuvasz, keeping a large kennel and doing much to improve the quality of the breed. In the succeeding centuries, the kuvasz gradually came into the hands of commoners, who found them to be capable livestock dogs. During this period, the name was corrupted to its present spelling, which ironically, translates as mongrel. Incidentally, the plural form of kuvasz is kuvaszok. The breed seriously declined as a result of two World Wars, but German stock formed a basis for the breed to continue through these hard times.

These dogs, medium-sized black dogs with close hair, not only retrieved game but also retrieved fish, pulled small fishing boats through icy water and helped the fisherman in any task involving swimming. Eventually the breed died out in Newfoundland in large part because of a heavy dog tax. However, a core of Labradors had been taken to England in the early 1800s, and it is from these dogs, along with crosses to other retrievers, that the breed continued. It was also in England that the breed earned his reputation as an extraordinary retriever of upland game. Initially breeders favored black Labs, and culled yellow or chocolate colors. By the early 1900s, the other colors had become acceptable, although still not as widely favored as the blacks. The breed was recognized by the English Kennel Club in 1903 and by the AKC in 1917.

His history is intertwined with Buddhist beliefs, including a belief in reincarnation. The souls of lamas were said to enter the sacred dog's bodies upon death, thus imparting an added reverence for these dogs. The dogs also performed the role of monastery watchdog, sounding the alert to visitors, thus giving rise to their native name of Abso Seng Kye (bark lion sentinel dog). It is likely that the breed's Western name of Lhasa Apso is derived from his native name, although some contend that it is a corruption of the Tibetan word Rapso, meaning 'goat' (in reference to his goatlike coat). In fact, when the breed first came to England, he was known as the Lhassa Terrier, although he is in no way a terrier. The first Lhasa Apsos were seen in the Western world around 1930, with some of the first dogs arriving as gifts of the 13th Dalai Lama. The breed was admitted into the AKC's terrier group in 1935, but was reassigned to the nonsporting group in 1959.

Her origin is unknown, but she was first described living among the native Inuit people known as the Mahlemuts, who lived along Norton Sound on Alaska's northwest coast. The word Mahlemut comes from Mahle, an Inuit tribe name, and mut, meaning village. The dogs served as hunting partners for big game (such as seals and polar bears), and hauled the heavy carcasses back home. These dogs were, of necessity, large and strong rather than fast, enabling one dog to do the work of many smaller dogs. They were an essential cog in the Inuits' lives and were treated almost as one of the family, although they were never pampered as pets. The unforgiving environment meant that a less than optimal dog would probably not have been kept. When the first outside explorers came to the region in the 1700s, they were impressed not only by the hardy dog but also by their pet parents' obvious attachment to them. With the discovery of gold in 1896, a flood of outsiders came to Alaska; for entertainment, they staged weight-pulling contests and races among their dogs. The native breeds were interbred with each other and those brought by settlers, often in an attempt to create a faster racer or simply to provide the vast numbers of dogs needed to supply the gold rush. The pure malamute was in danger of being lost. In the 1920s, a New England dog-racing enthusiast obtained some good specimens and began to breed traditional malamutes. As the breed's reputation grew, some were chosen to help Adm. Byrd in his 1933 trek to the South Pole. During World War II, malamutes were once again called into service, this time to serve as freight haulers, pack animals and search-and-rescue dogs. In 1935, the breed received AKC recognition and began a new phase as an imposing show dog and loyal pet.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/alaskan-malamute',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_22908_alaskan-malamute-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaskan_Malamute',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/alaskan-malamute',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/alaskan-malamute/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Alaskan-Malamute.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/alaskan-malamute',\n\t},\n\tmalinois: {\n\t\tdesc: `The Belgian sheep-herding breeds, collectively known as chiens de berger Belge, shared their early history as general-purpose shepherds and guard dogs of Belgium. As working dogs, they were bred for ability rather than esthetics, and no careful records were kept. Thus, when dog shows became popular in the late 1800s, it was not clear if Belgium had any recognizable breeds with which they could tout their national pride. In 1891, professor Adolphe Reul was asked to study the native dogs to see if they could be sorted into distinct breeds. He found a group of similar dogs that differed only in coat type and color, all of which were grouped as Belgian Shepherds. The shorthaired variety was developed in the area around Malines, and so became known as the Belgian Malinois. The Malinois remains the most popular of the Belgian shepherd breeds in his native land, but has had a rockier road in America. Between 1911 and World War II, the Malinois enjoyed a good deal of popularity in America. After the war, registrations plummeted, and it was rare to find a Malinois entered in competition. When the breeds were separated in 1959, Malinois registrations began to grow once again, but they still fell far behind the other Belgian breeds. More recently, the Malinois is becoming popular because of his reputation as one of the pre-eminent police dogs in the world, surpassing even the German Shepherd in demand. Thus, even though the Malinois may not be seen in many homes or show rings, this breed is making its presence known as a keeper of the peace throughout the world.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/belgian-malinois',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23172_belgian-malinois-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malinois_dog',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/belgian-malinois',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/belgian-malinois/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Belgian-Malinois.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/belgian-malinois',\n\t},\n\tmaltese: {\n\t\tdesc: `The Maltese is the most ancient of the European toy breeds, and among the oldest of all breeds. The island of Malta was an early trading port, visited by Phoenician sailors by 1500 B.C. Maltese dogs are specifically mentioned in writings as early as 300 B.C. Greek art includes dogs of Maltese type from the fifth century on; there is evidence that tombs were even erected to favor Maltese. Although the dogs were often exported and subsequently widely distributed throughout Europe and Asia, the core population on Malta remained relatively isolated from other dogs, resulting in this distinctive dog that bred true for centuries. Though the Maltese's hallmark is her long, silky, dazzling white hair, early Maltese came in colors other than white. By the early 14th century, Maltese had been brought to England, where they became the darlings of upper-class ladies. Writers of the succeeding centuries continually commented upon their diminutive size. Still, these little dogs were never commonplace, and an 1830 painting entitled The Lion Dog From Malta, Last of His Race suggests that the breed may have been in danger of extinction. Soon after, two Maltese were brought to England from Manila. Although originally intended as a gift for Queen Victoria, they passed into other hands, and their offspring became the first Maltese exhibited in England. At this time, they were called Maltese terriers, despite the lack of terrier ancestry or characteristics. In America, the first Maltese were shown as \"Maltese lion dogs\" around 1877. The name lion dog probably arose from the habit of dog fanciers, particularly those in Asia, of clipping the dogs to look like lions. The AKC recognized the breed as the Maltese in 1888. The Maltese slowly increased in popularity and now ranks as one of the more popular toys.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/maltese',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23114_maltese-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltese_dog',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/maltese',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/maltese/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Maltese.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/maltese',\n\t},\n\tmastiff: {\n\t\tdesc: `The mastiff is the prototypical breed of the ancient mastiff group of dogs. The confusion between the mastiff breed and the mastiff family makes it very difficult to trace the history of the breed. Even though the mastiff family is one of the oldest and most influential, the breed is undoubtedly of more recent, though still ancient, origin. By the time of Caesar, mastiffs were used as war dogs and gladiators. In medieval times, they were used as guard dogs and hunting dogs and became so widespread as to become commonplace. Mastiffs later stepped into the arena of dog fighting, bull-baiting and bearbaiting. Even when these cruel sports were banned in England in 1835, they continued to be popular events. The modern mastiff descends not only from these pit dogs but also from more noble lines, being descendants of one of the most famous mastiffs of all time: the mastiff of Sir Peers Legh. When Legh was wounded in the battle of Agincourt, his mastiff stood over him and protected him for many hours through the battle. Although Legh later died, the mastiff returned to his home and was the foundation of the Lyme Hall mastiffs. Five centuries later the Lyme Hall mastiffs figured prominently in founding the modern breed. Some evidence exists that the mastiff came to America on the Mayflower, but the breed's documented entry to America did not occur until the late 1800s. The breed was nearly decimated in England by World War II, but sufficient numbers had been brought to America by that time to keep the breed going.

Here the agreement about her origin ceases. Although she ultimately traces back to the Tibetan mastiff, no actual record exists of Tibetan mastiffs being brought to Newfoundland. Some authorities believe that she descends from the Tibetan mastiff by way of the Great Pyrenees. In 1662, the first permanent colony at Roougnoust was settled, complete with Great Pyrenees dogs. These dogs were crossed with black English retrievers belonging to English settlers. Some Husky blood may also have been introduced. Whatever the ingredients, the result was a massive water-loving, cold-resistant dog found in either a solid black or black and white coloration. The latter \"Landseer\" Newfoundland was only identified in 1779. The Newfoundland name predates her only by a few years, named after an individual dog called Newfoundland. The Newfoundland distinguished herself as an all-purpose water dog, hauling heavy fishing nets through the cold water and saving many people from watery graves. Her work didn't stop on dry land; here she served as a draft dog and pack animal. European visitors were so impressed that they returned to Europe with many specimens, and it is here that the breed first entered the show ring. The export of dogs from Newfoundland, along with laws forbidding ownership of more than one dog, drove the breed's numbers down in her place of origin. The breed's stronghold switched to England, and American fanciers resorted to replenishing their stock with English dogs. After World War II, the tables turned, and American Newfoundlands were responsible for reviving the decimated English stock. Recovery in both countries is now complete, and the Newfoundland is one of the more popular of the giant breeds of dogs. Although the solid black color is most identified with the breed, the black and white Newfoundlands (dubbed Landseers after the well-known artist who first portrayed them) are also popular.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/newfoundland',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_22938_newfoundland-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_dog',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/newfoundland',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/newfoundland/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Newfoundland.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/newfoundland',\n\t},\n\totterhound: {\n\t\tdesc: `One of the most unusual members of the hound group is the Otterhound, a hardy, tousled scenthound of uncertain origin. The breed may have originated in France, and closely resembles the old French Venden hound. Other breeds that may have played a part in his origin were the Welsh harrier, Southern hound (a foxhound-like breed), bloodhound or a type of water spaniel. Whatever the genetic makeup, the Otterhound came to fill a unique niche as a hunter of otters in England and is thus most associated with that country. King John kept the first documented packs of Otterhounds in 1212. The breed was useful for finding otters that were depleting fish in local streams. They would trail the otter to its den and bay when locating it. The hunters would then remove the Otterhounds and send small terriers to dispatch the otter. Otter hunting was never among the most popular of sports, lacking the formal trappings of fox hunting and taking place under wet and uncomfortable conditions. Nonetheless, the sport reached its peak during the latter half of the 19th century, when over 20 packs were hunting in Britain, but it essentially died out after the Second World War. The first Otterhound came to America at the beginning of the 20th century and was recognized by the AKC soon after. Otterhound aficionados have been especially adamant that the breed retain its functional characteristics, without succumbing to exaggerated grooming practices or the temptation to breed only for a competitive show dog. Even though this practice has maintained the true Otterhound type, the breed has never been especially popular as a show dog or pet. Despite the fact that the Otterhound is one of the most ancient of the English breeds, he is one of the rarest of English Kennel Club or AKC recognized breeds, verging perilously close to extinction.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/otterhound',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23034_otterhound-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otterhound',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/otterhound',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/otterhound/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Otterhound.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/otterhound',\n\t},\n\tpapillon: {\n\t\tdesc: `The name papillon is French for butterfly, which the face and ears of this sprightly little dog should resemble. The papillon has his roots in the dwarf spaniels that were so popular throughout Europe from at least the 16th century. These little dogs were extremely popular with the nobility; as time went on, Spain and Italy became the centers of dwarf-spaniel breeding and trading. The court of Louis XIV of France was particularly fond of papillons and imported many of them. At one time the papillon was known as the squirrel spaniel because he carried his plumed tail over his back in the same way a squirrel does. These early dogs had drooping ears, but through some unknown event, some dogs sported erect ears. Both drop- and erect-eared papillons could be found in the same litter. Even today both ear types are equally correct, although the erect-eared dog is much more popular. In America, the drop-eared pap is known as the phalene, which is French for moth, whereas in Europe he is called the epagneul nain or Continental toy spaniel. By 1900, the papillon was well-represented at French dog shows and soon afterward was being shown in England and America. These earlier exhibits tended to be larger than those seen today, and featured mostly solid-colored dogs, usually of some shade of red. Selective breeding has resulted in a smaller dog that is distinguished by his striking colors broken by patches of white. A symmetrically marked face with white blaze adds to the butterfly appearance. The papillon has become one of the more popular toy dogs, functioning equally well as a loving pet, beautiful show dog and adept obedience competitor.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/papillon',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23118_papillon-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillon_dog',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/papillon',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/papillon/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Papillon.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/papillon',\n\t},\n\tpekinese: {\n\t\tdesc: `The Pekingese owes her existence to the Lamaist form of Buddhism in China, in which the lion was an exalted symbol of Buddha, sometimes appearing in miniaturized form. The Foo dogs then in existence bore some resemblance to a lion and were carefully bred to accentuate this similarity. In fact, these dogs eventually came to be known as lion dogs. Extensive breeding programs fell under the auspices of palace eunuchs, with no expense spared. At the height of their favor (during the T'ang Dynasty from A.D. 700 to A.D. 1000) many of these lion dogs were literally treated as royalty, pampered by personal servants. Smaller Pekingese were called sleeve dogs because they could be carried in the large sleeves of their Chinese masters. In 1860, the British looted the Imperial Summer. Among their loot were five royal lion dogs, which were taken back to England. One was presented to Queen Victoria, and she, along with the other four, caused such interest among dog fanciers that there arose great demand for more of these dogs.

Although these little dogs specialized in herding cattle, nipping at their heels and then ducking under their kicking hooves, they were almost certainly also used in herding sheep and even Welsh ponies. Despite claims for the antiquity of the breed, it is difficult to trace the breed's origins or even authenticate its existence in early times. A Welsh cattle dog is mentioned in a book of the 11th century, however. Although he certainly shares his past with the Cardigan Welsh Corgi, the Pembroke was developed separately, in Pembrokeshire, Wales. As a hard-working dog, the corgi was out in the fields when many of the early dog shows were being held. Only in 1926 did a club form and the breed enter the show ring. The first exhibits were straight from the farm and aroused only modest attention. Breeders subsequently strove to improve upon the breed's inherent good looks and were rewarded with increased popularity. The obvious differences between the Pembroke and Cardigan were troublesome to judges. The Pembroke is smaller, with sharper features, a more foxlike expression and characteristically no tail. In 1934, the Cardigan and Pembroke corgis were divided into two separate breeds, after which the Pembroke soared in popularity. His appeal was heightened when he became the favorite of King George VI and, subsequently, Queen Elizabeth II. By the 1960s, the Pembroke had become one of the most popular pet breeds all over the world, but especially in Britain. This popularity has since waned slightly, but far more Pembrokes can be found herding in back yards than in farmyards today.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/pembroke-welsh-corgi',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23192_pembroke-welsh-corgi-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembroke_Welsh_Corgi',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/pembroke-welsh-corgi',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/pembroke-welsh-corgi/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Pembroke-Welsh-Corgi.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/pembroke-welsh-corgi',\n\t},\n\tpointer: {\n\t\tdesc: `The earliest pointers were used in the 17th century not to point birds, but to point hare, which coursing greyhounds were then unleashed to pursue. When wing-shooting became popular in the 18th century, the pointer found his place as an adept bird locator. The ideal dog would find game, indicate its location and remain still until the hunter could get ready to shoot, a task that was somewhat slow with the old flintlock guns. The early pointer probably included in his genetic makeup some of the most talented breeds in existence: greyhounds, foxhounds and bloodhounds, as well as an old type of setting spaniel. Different countries developed different pointer breeds. The large, ponderous Spanish pointer was crossed with the English pointer to increase pointing ability, but at the expense of agility. With the advent of self-loading guns in the 19th century, the slower working traits of the Spanish pointer became undesirable, so the crosses were discontinued. In the 19th century, crosses with setters were made, perhaps to improve disposition and make the dogs more amenable to training and less prone to try to catch the game. Pointers became popular for recreational hunting on large estates. Ideally, two pointers were used so that the hunter could locate the bird precisely by cross-referencing the dogs' points. When dog shows came in vogue in the late 19th century, pointers were among the most prominent of the breeds shown. Pointers remain very popular as competitive field trial dogs and recreational hunters; however, they are not as popular as pets as many other sporting breeds.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/pointer',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_22992_pointer-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(dog_breed)',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/pointer',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/pointer/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: '',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/pointer',\n\t},\n\tpomeranian: {\n\t\tdesc: `The smallest member of the spitz family, the Pomeranian boasts tough sledding dog ancestors.

The breed's likely ancestor was the Deutscher spitz. Only when the breed was taken to England was he dubbed the Pomeranian, but these early dogs were not the \"Poms\" known today. They weighed as much as 30 pounds and were often white. In fact, the Japanese spitz closely resembles these early Pomeranians and very likely descends from them. Although the Pomeranian was recognized by the English Kennel Club in 1870, it was not until Queen Victoria brought a Pomeranian from Italy that his popularity grew. The queen's Pomeranians were rather large gray dogs, and even then most fanciers preferred smaller, more colorful specimens. By 1900, Poms had been recognized by the AKC, and dogs were being shown in both England and America in an array of colors. The Pomeranian has continued to be bred down in size; at the same time, an emphasis on coat has led to his unsurpassed \"puffball\" appearance.

Interwoven in their ancestry are also several rough-coated water dogs. Perhaps the earliest incarnation of the Poodle was the Barbet, a curly-coated dog distributed in France, Russia, Hungary and elsewhere. He is the German version, however, that exerted most influence on the modern Poodle. In fact, the word Poodle comes from the German word pfudel, meaning 'puddle' or 'to splash', probably reflecting the dog's water abilities. In France, it was known as Caniche or Chien Canard, both referring to its duck-hunting abilities. Thus, from herding and water roots the Poodle became a talented water-hunting companion. The Poodle was also drawn into service as a military dog, guide dog, guard dog, wagon puller for performers and, eventually, as a circus performer. His coat was shorn close to facilitate swimming, but left slightly longer on the chest for warmth in cold water. Although some believe the puffs of hair around the leg joints and tail tip were for protection when hunting, compelling evidence suggests that they arose as decoration during the Poodle's performing days. The Poodle found favor as an elegant companion for fashionable ladies. He became favored by French aristocracy and eventually became the national dog of France. His characteristic clip was accentuated, and a successful effort was made to perfect the smaller specimens. Poodles entered the show ring in the late 1800s. Some of the early show Poodles were shown in corded coats, in which the hair is allowed to mat in long thin tresses rather than be brushed out. While eye-catching, the upkeep was difficult and the trend died out by the early 1900s, being replaced by the bouffant styles still in vogue. At the same time Poodle popularity in America waned, so that by the late 1920s, Poodles had almost died out in North America. In the 1930s, the breed staged a comeback that eventually placed it as the all-time most popular dog in America.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/poodle-(standard)',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23200_poodle-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poodle',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/poodle',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/poodle-miniature-standard/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Poodle.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/poodle',\n\t},\n\tpug: {\n\t\tdesc: `The pug has been known by many names: mopshond in Holland (which refers to his grumbling tendencies); mops in Germany, and Dutch or Chinese pug in England. The word pug is derived either from the Latin pugnus, meaning fist, as the head may have resembled a clenched fist, or from the marmoset \"pug\" monkeys that were popular pets in the 18th century and that the pug dogs somewhat resemble. Whatever the name, one thing is true: The pug's official motto multum in parvo (\"a lot in a little\") fits him exactly. The pug is somewhat of an exception in the toy group because he is perhaps the only breed to be descended from mastiff forebears. Although his exact ancestry has been lost in antiquity, the pug retains many mastiff characteristics. This is an ancient breed, one of several miniaturized in Asia, where he was a favorite pet of Buddhist monasteries in Tibet many centuries ago. In China, the facial wrinkles were an essential breed feature, most notably the \"prince mark,\" or vertical wrinkle on the forehead, which bore a resemblance to the Chinese character for \"prince.\" Pugs probably came to Holland by way of the Dutch East India Trading Company. They became quite popular and were recognized as the official dog of the House of Orange after one saved the life of Prince William by sounding an alarm at the approach of Spanish soldiers in 1572. By 1790, the pug could be found in France; Napoleon's wife Josephine used her pug to carry messages to Napoleon when she was imprisoned. Pugs were first brought to England during Victorian times and became incredibly popular with the wealthy, displacing the King Charles spaniel as the favored royal breed. Several pugs were brought to England from China in 1886. A year earlier, the breed had been recognized by the AKC. Since that time, he has remained popular as both a pet and show dog.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/pug',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23124_pug-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pug',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/pug',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/pug/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Pug.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/pug',\n\t},\n\tpyrenees: {\n\t\tdesc: `Also known as the Pyrenean mountain dog, the Great Pyrenees is a very old breed, probably descending from the Tibetan mastiff. She may have come to Europe with the Aryans from Central Asia, as well as with Phoenician sea traders. They settled in the Spanish Pyrenees and in various mountain valleys in Europe. She was used from the earliest times to guard flocks. A painting of the times shows a pair of these guards, each wearing a spiked iron collar to protect her throat from animal or human adversaries. In medieval France, the Pyrenees became a formidable fortress guard, and eventually a band of these imposing dogs was the pride of many large chateaus. In the late 1600s, the breed caught the eye of the French nobility, and for a brief time they were in great demand in the court of Louis XIV. In fact, in 1675 the Great Pyrenees was decreed the \"Royal Dog of France\" by Louis XIV. Around the same time the Great Pyrenees came to Newfoundland, where she may have played a role in the development of the Newfoundland breed, but she did not herself continue as a pure breed. The first documented Pyrenees came to America with Gen. Lafayette in 1824. By the 1900s, the breed had disappeared from French court life, and the remaining dogs were those found still working in the isolated Basque countryside. Many of the poorer puppies were sold to tourists who brought them back to England and other countries. These dogs bore little resemblance to the magnificent Pyrenees that had once been so admired, however. Interest in the breed declined in England, but fortunately the breed still existed in sufficient numbers and quality in her native mountain land so that later fanciers were able to obtain good breeding stock. These dogs served as the foundation of the modern Pyrenees. Serious importation of the breed to America occurred in the 1930s, and by 1933 the Great Pyrenees received AKC recognition.

These settlers needed a dog that could withstand both hot and cold temperatures, limited water and rough bush, while performing the duties of guard dog and hunting dog. By breeding their European dogs with native Hottentot tribal hunting dogs (which were distinguished by a ridge of hair growing in the opposite direction along the top of their back) they produced just such a dog. These dogs hunted by both sight and scent and were devoted protectors of the entire family. In the 1870s, several were taken to Rhodesia to hunt lions, chasing and harassing the lion until the hunter could shoot it. The 'lion dogs' were so successful that they soon became popular, their distinctive ridge becoming a trademark of quality. By the 1920s, so many different types of ridged lion dogs existed in Rhodesia that a meeting was held to elucidate the most desirable points of the breed, which became the basis for the current standard. Dogs meeting the standard criteria were known as Rhodesian Ridgebacks (the dogs' former designation as lion dogs was deemed to sound too savage). The breed was introduced into England in the 1930s and America soon after. In both countries, it gained recognition in the 1950s and quickly attracted admirers. In the 1980s, the breed received recognition as a sighthound and became eligible to compete in sighthound field trials.

At least one of these marches led to southern Germany, where some of the people and their dogs settled. Throughout the succeeding centuries, the dogs continued to play a vital role as cattle drovers around what was to become the town of Rottweil (which is derived from red tile, denoting the red-tile roof of the Roman baths that had been unearthed there in the eighth century). Rottweil prospered and became a center of cattle commerce. Their dogs drove and guarded cattle, guarded the money earned by the cattle sales and served as draft animals. So evolved the Rottweiler metzgerhund (\"butcher dog\"), an integral component in the town's industry until the mid-19th century. At that time, cattle driving was outlawed, and dog carting was replaced by donkey carts and railroads. With little need for this once vital breed, the Rottweiler fell into such decline that he was nearly lost. With the realization that the breed was teetering near extinction, dog fanciers formed a club in 1901 and set about to revive him. Even though the 1901 club was short-lived, it did formulate a breed standard. Two subsequent clubs were formed in 1907, one of which promoted the breed as a police dog. The two clubs merged in 1921. The breed continued to grow, and by the 1930s he was competing in AKC competitions.

Arab nomads used Salukis to run down gazelles, foxes and hares in the desert, often with the aid of falcons. Although the Muslim religion considered the dog to be unclean, an exception was made for the Saluki, which was referred to as el hor, the \"noble one.\" As the provider of meat, the Saluki was allowed to sleep in the tents and enjoy the tender attention of its Bedouin master. Salukis were not allowed to breed with non-Salukis, which accounts for their purity throughout the centuries. Because Salukis ranged with their nomadic owners over a wide area of the Middle East, they became widely distributed with great local variation, resulting in the breed's variability today. The Saluki came to the attention of the Western world around 1900 and was recognized by the AKC in 1928. Their numbers have decreased in their lands of origin as a result of the advent of hunting with guns from jeeps. The primary role of the Saluki today is as an exotic companion and show dog, although many of these dogs are still used for hare coursing.

They also depended upon strong hardy spitz dogs to herd the reindeer and to guard them against the fierce predators of the Arctic. They occasionally helped to hunt bears and tow boats and sledges. These dogs lived as part of the family in the hide tents of their people, where one of their \"jobs\" was to keep the children warm in bed. The first Samoyeds came to England in the late 1800s, but not all these early imports were the pure white the breed is known for today. One of these dogs was presented to Queen Alexandria, who did much to promote the breed. Descendants of the queen's dogs can still be found in modern pedigrees. In 1906, the first Samoyed came to America, originally a gift of Russia's Grand Duke Nicholas. Meanwhile, the breed was becoming a popular sled dog because she was more tractable than other sledding breeds. In the early 1900s, Samoyeds formed part of the sled teams on expeditions to Antarctica and shared in the triumph of reaching the South Pole. The breed's exploits, combined with her glistening good looks, soon won the public's attention in America, and her popularity has grown tremendously since the Second World War.

One plausible theory is that he originated as a dog of the boatmen who traveled between Brussels and Antwerp. The Flemish word for boat is schip, and Schipperke is thus thought to mean 'little boatman'.ÃÂ The breed was less commonly called Schipperke by Belgian townspeople, however, who more often referred to it as Spitz. The other plausible theory of origin is that it was a dog of tradesmen guilds and middle-class households who wanted a small watchdog and ratter. The breed resembles a miniature Belgian Sheepdog, and it is possible that Schipperke derives from the word Scheper, or Shepherd. In fact, a breed of dog intermediate in size was one known in the region. Although small, black dogs are mentioned in Belgian writings of the 15th and 16th centuries, definite evidence of Schipperkes is not found until 1690. A group of Brussels shoemakers organized regular Schipperke competitions, taking special pride in adorning their companions with ornate brass collars. By the 19th century the breed was so popular in central Belgium that it was virtually the only house dog found there, and was acknowledged as the national dog. In 1885 Queen Marie Henriette acquired a Schipperke she saw at a dog show. After people saw the little dog with her, it sparked great interest in the breed from people of all classes, and the workman's companion thus became companion to the elite. At the same time, the breed's numbers were depleted by exports to England, where they had become extremely fashionable. Most people in Belgium considered the breed common and preferred more exotic breeds. In the late 1880s, a group of Belgian Schipperke fanciers grouped to try to save the breed, setting forth the breed's desirable points. Soon after, the first Schipperke came to America.

Of these, the smallest and probably most ancient is the Shiba Inu. In fact, one theory about the name Shiba is that it simply denotes small; however, it may also mean brushwood in reference to the brilliant red brushwood trees that so closely matched the breed's red coat and through which they hunted. These theories have resulted in the Shibas being nicknamed the 'little brushwood dog'. The origin of the Shiba is unclear; but is clearly of Spitz heritage and may have been used as early as 300 B.C. as a hunting dog in central Japan. Although they were used mostly to flush birds and small game, they were occasionally used to hunt wild boar. Three main types existed and each was named for its area of origin: the Shinshu Shiba (rom the Nagano Prefecture), the Mino Shiba (from the Gifu Prefecture), and the Sanin Shiba (from the northeast mainland). After World War II, the breed was nearly lost, and it was further decimated by distemper in 1952. In an attempt to save the Shiba Inu, the different types were interbred, crossing the heavier-boned dogs from mountainous regions with the lighter-boned dogs from other regions. As a result, the Shiba survived as one breed, with some variation in bone substance. The first Shiba came to America in 1954 and was officially recognized by the AKC in 1993. Since then, Shibas have achieved a staunch following, and their popularity continues to grow.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/shiba-inu',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23160_shiba-inu-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiba_Inu',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/shiba-inu',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/shiba-inu/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Shiba-Inu.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/shiba-inu',\n\t},\n\tshihtzu: {\n\t\tdesc: `Shih Tzu (or more properly, Shih Tzu Kou) means \"lion dog,\" designating the breed as one of the most esteemed animals in China because of its association with Buddhism. Even though the Shih Tzu is most often associated with China, he probably originated in Tibet as early as the 17th century, where he enjoyed status as a holy dog. The Shih Tzu, as he is known today, developed most distinctively in China during the reign of Empress Dowager Cixi (Tzu-shi, 1861-1908). The Shih Tzu and Pekingese share similar histories; however, the Shih Tzu can usually be differentiated from the Pekingese in Chinese art by the presence of bumps on the tops of the head, denoting a topknot, or pien-ji. The Shih Tzu was a favored house pet during the Ming Dynasty and was highly prized by the royal family. When the British looted the Imperial Palace, most of the dogs were lost, and the breed suffered a great setback. The Shih Tzu was first exhibited in China as the Lhassa terrier or Tibetan poodle. In 1935, he was exhibited as the Lhassa lion dog; by that time, he was becoming very popular. A similar state of confusion existed in England, where the Lhasa apso and Shih Tzu were both lumped together as the apso (meaning shaggy). In 1934, soon after the apso was first shown, it was divided into two separate breeds, with the smaller, wider-skulled, shorter-nosed dogs from Peking dubbed Shih Tzu, their colloquial Chinese name. In 1952 a single Pekingese cross was authorized to improve certain points, but such crosses have never again been permitted. In the United States, the breed began to become extremely popular in the 1960s, leading to AKC recognition in 1969. His popularity has continued to grow, and he is one of the most popular toys.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/shih-tzu',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23126_shih-tzu-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shih_Tzu',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/shih-tzu',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/shih-tzu/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Shih-Tzu.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/shih-tzu',\n\t},\n\tspringer: {\n\t\tdesc: `As the spaniels became increasingly specialized, the larger land spaniels that ranged farther afield became extremely useful at flushing or \"springing\" game. Before the advent of shotguns, the game was flushed into nets or then chased by falcons or greyhounds. The first reference to springers referred to land spaniels in the late 1500s. Around 1800, distinct strains of carefully bred springers began to develop; one of the best known was bred by the Duke of Norfolk. His dogs so heavily influenced the breed that for a while the breed was called Norfolk spaniels. The name was changed to springer spaniel in 1900. The matter is complicated by the fact that the larger springer and smaller cocker spaniels were simply size variations of the same breed. Only in 1902 did the English Kennel Club recognize the springer as a distinct breed. In America, the American Spaniel Club was formed in 1880 and began the task of separating the springer and cocker sizes. After separation, the springer continued to thrive. He has remained popular with hunters demanding a versatile gun dog that ranges fast and far and that can also flush and retrieve. He is also a popular show dog and pet.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/english-springer-spaniel',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_22970_english-springer-spaniel-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Springer_Spaniel',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/english-springer-spaniel',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/english-springer-spaniel/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/English-Springer-Spaniel.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/english-springer-spaniel',\n\t},\n\tstbernard: {\n\t\tdesc: `The Saint Bernard probably has his roots in the Roman Molossian dogs, but it wasn't until between 1660 and 1670 that the breed developed into the magnificent dog responsible for saving so many lives. Around this time, the first of these large dogs arrived at the St. Bernard Hospice, a refuge for travelers crossing between Switzerland and Italy. The Saint Bernards originally came to help pull carts and turn spits and may have also functioned as watchdogs or companions, but the monks soon found them invaluable pathfinders through the deep snow. The dogs were adept at locating lost travelers. When a dog found a person, he would lick the person's face and lie beside him, thus reviving and warming the person. The dogs continued to serve in this invaluable role for three centuries, saving over 2,000 lives. The most famous of all Saint Bernards was Barry, who was credited with saving 40 lives. Before Barry's death, the dogs were known by several names, including hospice dogs, but by the time he died he was of such fame that the dogs were called Barryhund in his honor. In the early 1800s many of the dogs were lost to severe weather, disease and inbreeding. Some of the remaining dogs were crossed with Newfoundlands in 1830. As a result, the first long-coated dogs of Saint Bernard type appeared. Although it seemed that long hair would help a dog in the cold snow, in fact it hindered them as the ice clung to the coat. Thus, these long-haired dogs were not kept for rescue work. The first Saints came to England around 1810 and were referred to by many different names, among them sacred dog. By 1865, the name Saint Bernard was in common use, and it became the official name in 1880. Around this time, the breed caught the eye of American fanciers. By 1900, the Saint Bernard was extremely popular. Although he has since vacillated in popularity, he is always one of the most popular giant breeds.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/saint-bernard',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_22944_saint-bernard-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bernard_(dog)',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/saint-bernard',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/st-bernard/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Saint-Bernard.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/saint-bernard',\n\t},\n\tvizsla: {\n\t\tdesc: `The vizsla's forebears may have included breeds that the Magyars collected as they swarmed across Europe before settling in Hungary over a thousand years ago. Writings on falconry from the Middle Ages describe dogs of vizsla type. The Hungarian plains were rich in game, and hunters wanted a fast but close-working dog that could not only point and retrieve birds but trail mammals over thick ground cover. The breed was unquestionably established by the 18th century, having found special favor with barons and warlords of the time. By the end of the 19th century, however, the breed had greatly declined in numbers. He was revived through the discovery and careful breeding of about a dozen good specimens. World War II spread the vizsla throughout the world. Hungarians fleeing Russian occupation took their pointing dogs to various other countries, including America, where their handsome appearance and exceptional hunting abilities were soon appreciated. AKC recognition came in 1960. Once again, the vizsla quickly gained admirers, and the breed is now regularly seen in the field, show ring and home. He is also sometimes called the Hungarian vizsla or Hungarian pointer.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/vizsla',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_22996_vizsla-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vizsla',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/vizsla',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/vizsla/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Vizsla.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/vizsla',\n\t},\n\tweimaraner: {\n\t\tdesc: `Germany has always been a country rich in wildlife, and German dog breeds have gained the reputation as some of the best in the world. The Weimaraner was produced in the 19th century by a concerted effort to create the ideal all-around gun dog that could hunt game of all sizes, including deer and bear. This effort was sponsored by the court of Weimer, and the breed was initially known as the Weimar pointer. Some of the breed's forebears include the bloodhound, red schweisshund and early pointing breeds. The origin of the Weimaraner's distinctive gray color is unknown, but it was an early feature of the breed. The breed's progress was strictly overseen by the German Weimaraner Club. Dogs could not be sold to nonmembers, and membership was hard to obtain. Dogs from nonapproved breedings could not be registered, and poor specimens had to be destroyed. Only when an American gained entry to the club and was allowed to take two dogs back to America in 1929 did the Weimaraner leave his native land. Early American Weimaraners performed so extraordinarily in obedience competitions that they aroused great interest. As more enthusiasts were attracted to the breed, they discovered his great worth as a hunting companion. AKC recognition came in 1943. The breed's beauty and versatility as personal gun dog, pet and competition dog have earned him a steady following.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/weimaraner',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn2-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_22998_weimaraner-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimaraner',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/weimaraner',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/weimaraner/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Weimaraner.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/weimaraner',\n\t},\n\twhippet: {\n\t\tdesc: `A medium-sized sighthound, the Whippet stems from greyhound roots. The Whippet's progenitors may have come from crosses between small Greyhounds and even smaller dogs that were used by peasants for poaching rabbits and other small game in the 18th century. The peasants also found entertainment in \"snap dog\" contests, in which bets were made on which dog could \"snap up\" as many rabbits as possible before they escaped from a circle. Crosses with ratting terriers were probably made to increase quickness and gameness. It was the advent of the Industrial Revolution, however, that spurred the development of the true whippet breed. Masses of rural workers moved to industrialized areas, bringing with them their snap dogs and a need for entertainment. Without a supply of rabbits, they found their dogs would just as readily race toward a waving rag. Rag racing became the sport of coal miners; in fact, the whippet was dubbed the \"poor man's race horse.\" A family's whippet was not only an immense source of pride but sometimes also a source of extra income and procurer of food for the pot. As a valued family member, he shared the family rations and often, the children's beds, and came to be valued as a companion as well. Whippet racing is still popular today, but it has never gained the commercial appeal of Greyhound racing and so remains strictly an amateur sport. After the Whippet was officially recognized as a breed in 1888, he began to be appreciated for his aesthetic appeal, and crosses with the Italian greyhound further refined his appearance. The whippet gained popularity slowly, but his unequaled combination of lithe elegance and gracious companionship gradually created a devoted following. Today the Whippet is the most popular of the sighthounds and is highly valued as a show dog, lure courser, racer and family companion.`,\n\t\tdescUrl: 'https://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/whippet',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://cdn1-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2011/01/file_23048_whippet-460x290.jpg',\n\t\twikiUrl: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whippet',\n\t\tdogtimeUrl: 'https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/whippet',\n\t\takcUrl: 'https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/whippet/',\n\t\tpetwaveUrl: 'https://www.petwave.com/Dogs/Breeds/Whippet.aspx',\n\t\tpurinaUrl: 'https://www.purina.com/dogs/dog-breeds/whippet',\n\t},\n\twolfhound: {\n\t\tdesc: `Dogs of great size are believed to have come to Ireland from Greece by 1500 B.C. In Ireland they became even more imposing, and gifts of these great dogs were made to Rome. The first definite mention of the Irish Wolfhound occurred in Rome in A.D. 391. The breed gained fame for its imposing stature and ability in fighting wild animals in arena sports. He was so acclaimed in Ireland that he became the subject of many legends recounting his valor in battle and chase. All large hounds were once known as cu, a term implying bravery. The Irish name for the breed is Cu Faoil. Favored by Irish chieftains for the hunt, he gained his reputation as an unparalleled hunter of wolves and Irish elk. Illustrations of these dogs from the 17th century look very similar to modern Irish Wolfhounds. The impressive hounds (often seven at a time) were traditionally given to foreign nobility. This practice, along with the extinction of the wolf in Ireland in the 18th century, contributed to the decline of the breed's numbers. By the 19th century, Irish Wolfhounds were almost extinct in Ireland, and the famine of 1845 virtually decimated the breed. In 1869, Capt. G. A. Graham determined to resurrect the Irish Wolfhound, a task he set about by crossing the few existing Wolfhounds (in particular one named Bran, thought to be the last true wolfhound in Ireland) with such breeds as the Scottish Deerhound as well as the Great Dane, the Borzoi and even the Tibetan wolf dog. When first exhibited at a dog show in the 1870s, the reborn Wolfhound created a sensation (the same reaction it inspires to this day when first seen). Its commanding appearance draws many admirers, but its popularity is tempered by the practicalities of keeping such a large dog.`,\n\t\tdescUrl:
